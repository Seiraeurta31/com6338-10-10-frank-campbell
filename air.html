Air quality significantly impacts human health, with pollutants like particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide posing serious risks. Respiratory problems, such as asthma and COPD, can worsen due to prolonged exposure to these pollutants. Moreover, air pollution also affects cardiovascular health, leading to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Emerging research suggests potential adverse effects on cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Additionally, pregnant women exposed to air pollution may experience complications and adverse birth outcomes, while weakened immune systems make individuals more susceptible to allergies and infections. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with a decline in lung function and a higher risk of chronic diseases like lung cancer and diabetes. Ensuring better air quality is vital for safeguarding public health and reducing the burden of pollution-related illnesses.</p>
